      <h1>Can we make a better maths textbook?</h1>
      
      <p>
        This is a little experiment to see how technology can be used to enhance the learning experience.
        I'm currently looking in to two possibilities:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Interactive explanations and explorations of concepts.</li>
        <li>Randomly generated questions with question-specific explanations.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Interactive explanations and explorations of concepts</h2>
      
      <p>
        Technology provides a way for a student to explore a topic in a way that isn't possible with traditional textbooks.
        For instance, suppose a student is learning about quadratic equations and how the coefficients of each term affect the shape of the curve.
        A traditional textbook might plot a few different equations side-by-side,
        or plot a few on the same graph.
        Alternatively, it might ask the student to do so.
        An online textbook has the option of drawing a quadratic equation,
        and then letting the student change a coefficient (for instance, by clicking and dragging) and see the result immediately.
        This immediacy might give the student a more intuitive grasp of the effect of that coefficient.
        As with traditional textbooks,
        some guidance is probably still required,
        such as asking
        "what happens if you double the coefficient of xÂ²?" or
        "what happens if you subtract 1 from the constant?".
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Below are a few examples for inspiration:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://euclidthegame.org/">Euclid: The Game</a></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Randomly generated questions with question-specific explanations</h2>
      
      <p>
        I've started to <a href="types-of-angles.html">explore the second possibility with a page for learning types of angles</a>,
        such as acute and obtuse.
        This page uses a randomly generated set of questions with question-specific explanations.
        Take a look to find out more.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I'm trying to discover if these possibilities provide significant advantage over traditional textbooks.
        Any feedback would be gratefully received by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:hello@zwobble.org">hello@zwobble.org</a>.
