      <h1>Can we make a better maths textbook?</h1>
      
      <p>
        This is a little experiment to see how technology can be used to enhance the learning experience.
        I'm currently looking in to two possibilities:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Interactive explanations and explorations of concepts.</li>
        <li>Improving questions and tests.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Interactive explanations and explorations of concepts</h2>
      
      <p>
        Technology provides a way for a student to explore a topic in a way that isn't possible with traditional textbooks.
        For instance, suppose a student is learning about quadratic equations and how the coefficients of each term affect the shape of the curve.
        A traditional textbook might plot a few different equations side-by-side,
        or plot a few on the same graph.
        Alternatively, it might ask the student to do so.
        An online textbook has the option of drawing a quadratic equation,
        and then letting the student change a coefficient (for instance, by clicking and dragging) and see the result immediately.
        This immediacy might give the student a more intuitive grasp of the effect of that coefficient.
        As with traditional textbooks,
        some guidance is probably still required,
        such as asking
        "what happens if you double the coefficient of xÂ²?" or
        "what happens if you subtract 1 from the constant?".
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Below are a few examples for inspiration:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://euclidthegame.org/">Euclid: The Game</a></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Improving questions and tests</h2>
      
      <p>
        Work-in-progress: <a href="types-of-angles.html">Types of angles</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Compared to a traditional textbook,
        there are a few possibilities for potentially improving questions and tests:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Specific help can be provided for each question.
          For instance,
          suppose a question asked a student to rearrange an equation to find the value of x.
          If the student became stuck, a hint specifically for that question could be provided.
          Alternatively, a worked solution could be shown,
          optionally with a full explanation of each of the steps.
          Although a traditional textbook might contain several worked examples,
          it would be impractical for it to contain worked solutions and full explanations for every single question.
        </li>
          
        <li>
          Spot tests could be generated as a student progresses through a course
          to refresh their knowledge of previous topics.
          Using their previous answers,
          such a test could concentrate on a student's weak areas.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Randomly generating questions rather than providing a fixed, limited set of questions.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Different styles of tests can be used depending on the circumstance.
          For instance,
          the test might continue asking questions until the student gets ten right in a row.
          Alternatively,
          there might be ten questions with a time limit for each.
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Teachers can view the results for each student immediately.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        I'm trying to discover if these possibilities provide significant advantage over traditional textbooks.
