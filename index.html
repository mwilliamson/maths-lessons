      <h1>Can we make a better maths textbook?</h1>
      
      <p>
        This is a little experiment to see how technology can be used to enhance the learning experience.
        I'm currently looking in to two possibilities:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Interactive explanations and explorations of concepts.</li>
        <li>Randomly generated questions with question-specific explanations.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        I've started to <a href="types-of-angles.html">explore the second possibility with a page for learning types of angles</a>,
        such as acute and obtuse.
        This page uses a randomly generated set of questions with question-specific explanations.
        Take a look to find out more.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I'm trying to discover if these possibilities provide significant advantage over traditional textbooks.
        Any feedback would be gratefully received by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:hello@zwobble.org">hello@zwobble.org</a>.
